## Development Notes & Lessons Learned

* **Deployment Challenges**: Aligning local Next.js v0 development (v0.dev) styling with Vercelâ€™s production build required troubleshooting Tailwind CSS imports (`globals.css`), PostCSS configuration, and ensuring `@tailwind` directives were processed.
* **Peer Dependency Fixes**: Resolved several NPM dependency conflicts (React types, Radix UI packages, lucide-react) by pinning versions and cleaning the lockfile.
* **AI-Assisted Coding**: Leveraged ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot extensively for:

  * Generating UI component boilerplate
  * Debugging CSS and build errors
  * Crafting README documentation
* **What I Learned**:

  * The importance of correct PostCSS setup (`postcss.config.js`) for Tailwind in production
  * How to integrate Prisma with Neon Postgres on a serverless platform
  * Best practices for structuring a Next.js 14+ app router project
